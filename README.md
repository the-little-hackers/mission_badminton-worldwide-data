## Overview

Badminton is managed by the [Badminton World Federation (BWF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_World_Federation) which regularly organizes several major international events. It has a [website](https://bwfbadminton.com/) allowing fans to access personalized player profiles and results from international tournaments.

However, this information is only accessible for consultation, through the numerous pages of the federation's website. It is not possible to download these data in a structured format that would allow analysis and statistics of tournament results.

To date, there is no structured and open data base on players and international badminton tournaments.
